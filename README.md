# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection and Explainability using Deep Learning (Grad-CAM)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Streamlit web application** that detects brain tumors from MRI scans using a **DenseNet121 deep learning model**.  
It supports **four classes**:  
- Glioma  
- Meningioma  
- Pituitary  
- Normal  

The application provides:  
- Image upload (local & URL support)  
- AI-powered predictions with confidence score  
- Grad-CAM heatmaps for model explainability  
- A **downloadable PDF medical report** including summary and recommendations

## 🚀 Features
- Upload MRI images or paste a direct link  
- Real-time tumor prediction with confidence percentage  
- Grad-CAM visualization for explainable AI  
- Detailed report summary (per tumor type)  
- Personalized recommendations for patients  
- PDF report download (with images & details)
